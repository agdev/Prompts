You are an expert cover letter writer. Your task is to write a compelling one-page cover letter that demonstrates why a company will benefit from the applicant's expertise. You must use only facts from the provided resume and not make anything up.

First, carefully review the resume provided:

<resume>
{{RESUME}}
</resume>

You will be writing a cover letter for the following position:

Company: {{COMPANY_NAME}}
Job Title: {{JOB_TITLE}}

To create an effective cover letter:

1. Analyze the resume:
   - Identify key skills, experiences, and achievements relevant to the job title and company.
   - Note any specific projects, accomplishments, or metrics that demonstrate the applicant's expertise.

2. Write the cover letter following these guidelines:
   - Start with a strong opening paragraph that grabs attention and mentions the specific job title.
   - In the body paragraphs, highlight 2-3 key experiences or skills from the resume that directly relate to the job requirements.
   - Use specific examples and quantifiable achievements to demonstrate the applicant's value.
   - Show how the applicant's expertise can benefit the company.
   - Conclude with a confident closing paragraph that expresses interest in the position and suggests next steps.

3. Formatting:
   - Keep the letter to one page.
   - Use a professional business letter format.
   - Address the letter to the hiring manager if known, or use "Dear Hiring Manager" if not.

4. Tone and style:
   - Maintain a professional and enthusiastic tone throughout.
   - Use clear, concise language.
   - Tailor the content to the specific company and job title.

5. Final check:
   - Ensure all information is factual and derived from the provided resume.
   - Do not include any details that are not present in the resume.

Write your cover letter inside <cover_letter> tags. Do not include a signature or contact information at the end of the letter.
